# Enbala Python Take-Home Project

This is a small project for Python candidates to demonstrate their expertise.
The project is standardized across our Python applicants, so that we can
compare candidates' skills in an unbiased way.

The goal is to query the GitHub API for a user's (publicly-available) repositories
and display some stats about them. You should also write some tests to verify
your implementation is correct.

🕰 We're aiming for this to take 30 minutes for senior candidates, 1 hour for junior<br>
🐍 Any recent version of the standard CPython (3.6+) is fine<br>
🔋 No dependencies, please (use the "batteries-included" standard library)<br>
🌅 Feel free to change any function signatures, add/remove/alter classes, etc. so long as
the user-observable functionality in `main()` works.

A great submission will demonstrate:

- Clarity of thinking (code communicates to your peers and your future self first, the computer second)
- An appreciation for "Pythonic" style
- An ability to manage complexity and think about tradeoffs

You don't need to worry too much about edge cases here. For instance, this
doesn't need to be a bulletproof implementation that can gracefully retry
in the face of network errors. For the sake of time, you can assume you'll
always receive well-formed API responses.

For "bonus points," include with your submission a brief discussion of how
you'd go about testing your implementation, and note any changes you might
want to make first to make the code more testable.
